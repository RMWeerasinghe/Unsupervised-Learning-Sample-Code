      "Allowance for Loan Losses  \n",
      " \n",
      "The allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) represents our best estimate of losses known and inherent in our loan portfolio \n",
      "that are both probable and reasonable to estimate. In de termining the amount of the ALLL, we consider the losses \n",
      "inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activities, along with general economic \n",
      "and real estate market conditions. We utilize a segmented approach which identifies: (1) classified loans for which the \n",
      "general valuation allowance for the respective loan type is deemed to be inadequate; and (2) performing loans for which \n",
      "a general valuation allowance is established. We maintain a loan review system which provi des for a systematic review \n",
      "of the loan portfolios and the identificatio n of impaired loans. The review of residential real estate and home equity \n",
      "consumer loans, as well as other more complex loans, is tr iggered by identified evaluation factors, including delinquency \n",
      "status, size of loan, type of collateral and the financial condition of the borrower. Charge-offs are established for \n",
      "impaired loans based on a review of such information and/or appraisals of the underlying co llateral. General reserves are \n",
      "based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss experience, composition of the loan \n",
      "portfolio, current economic conditions and management’s judgment. \n",
      " \n",
      "Although charge-offs and general reserves are established in accordance with management’s best estimates, actual losses \n",
      "are dependent upon future events, and as such, further provisions for loan losses may be necessary in order to maintain \n",
      "the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level.  For example, our evaluation of the allowance includes consideration \n",
      "of current economic conditions, and a change in economic  conditions could reduce the ability of borrowers to make \n",
      "timely repayments of their loans. This could result in in creased delinquencies and increased non-performing loans, and \n",
      "thus a need to make additional provisions for loan losses. Any provision reduces our net income. While the allowance is \n",
      "increased by the provision for loan lo sses, it is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be \n",
      "uncollectible are charged against the allo wance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the \n",
      "allowance. A change in economic conditions could adversely affect the value of properties collateralizing real estate \n",
      "loans, resulting in increased charges against the allowance an d reduced recoveries, and require additional provisions for \n",
      "loan losses. Furthermore, growth or a change in the compos ition of our loan portfolio could require additional provisions \n",
      "for loan losses. \n",

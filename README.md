# Unsupervised-Learning-Sample-Code
A repository containing notebooks related to unsupervised learning algorithms; K-Means, t-SNE and FP-Growth 
The following notebooks can be found in this repo:
##### Clustering_sentence_embeddings_using_kmeans.ipynb:
- K-Means clustering is used to group sentences in an annual report. The optimal K for clustering is selected by comparing the Silhouette Score of clustering for different k values.
- The clustering results of the embeddings (384 dimensional vectors) are visualized using t-SNE: An unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique
##### FP_Growth.ipynb
- Frequent patterns of a sample supermarket dataset is discovered using FP Growth algorithm.
